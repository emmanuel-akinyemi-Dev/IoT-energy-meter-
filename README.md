This is a code that helps to calculate the amount of energy usage in homes, using the Sct013 current sensor and zmpt101 voltage sensor module. 
i recommend sct013 current sensor, use a lover version, like 20amps, or 30 amps, the bigger it is the less it can sense low current..
you can use the emon example and tweak as you please if you find my code anyoying.
